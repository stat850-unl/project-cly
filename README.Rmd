## Instructions

Each member of your team should modify this document in some way and push their modifications to the repository in a separate commit. This will ensure that you have set your repository up in a way that ensures all group members are working with the same repository. 

Note that you must compile your readme (this document) for it to properly display as part of your github repository. 

Once you have received feedback on your project proposal (via Canvas) you may alter this README so that it describes your final project instead of the project proposal. 

## Data Set

[FoodData](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-datasets/FoodData_Central_csv_2020-04-29.zip) is an integrated database that provides food component and nutrient information.

Three tables from the database are chosen for this project:

* food_component.csv
* food_nutrient.csv
* nutrient.csv

By combining three datasets together and selecting several variables, a new dataset called **food_dataset** is generated for further analysis.

Description of ten variables:

* component_name - _The kind of component, e.g. bone_
   
* pct_weight - _The weight of the component as a percentage of the total weight of the food_
   
* is_refuse - _Whether the component is refuse, i.e. not edible_

* gram_weight - _The weight of the component in grams_

* nutrient_amount - _Amount of the nutrient per 100g of food. Specified in unit defined in the nutrient table._
   
* min - _The minimum amount_

* max - _The maximum amount_

* median - _The median amount_

* nutrient_name - _Name of the nutrient_

* nutrient_unit - _The standard unit of measure for the nutrient (per 100g of food)_


## Potential Topics to Explore Using the Data Set
Describe avenues you might explore using the data

There are several tables in the original database, we only take three of them and merge the variables together by **fdc_id**, which is a unique permanent identifier of a food across tables. We would like to discover potential recycling of non-edible food component which has relatively higher nutrient.
